### Title

     Tilte of the architecture design

### Status

     IN-PROGRESS 
     ON-HOLD 
     REJECTED
     ACCEPTED

### Context

    Write about the business/technical context along with the problem statement on why this design is being proposed

### Proposed Designs

#### Design 1
        1. How
            Explain how the proposed design approach works - if feasible, with diagram
        2. Why
            Explain why do you think this design is feasible
        3. Maintainability
            Explain how easy/hard it is to maintain it
        4. Performability
            Explain the performance perspective (scalability, latency, cpu/memory consumption)
        5. Testability
            Explain how easy/hard it is to test it (unit/integration/e2e/manual)
        6. Costability
            Explain if there are any cost implications due to this (like additional cpu requirement)

#### Design N
        1. How
            Explain how the proposed design approach works - if feasible, with diagram
        2. Why
            Explain why do you think this design is feasible
        3. Maintainability
            Explain how easy/hard it is to maintain it
        4. Performability
            Explain the performance perspective (scalability, latency, cpu/memory consumption)
        5. Testability
            Explain how easy/hard it is to test it (unit/integration/e2e/manual)
        6. Costability
            Explain if there are any cost implications due to this (like additional cpu requirement)

### Decision

    Brief on the rationale behind selected design in comparison with other Designs -
    this could be a summary of all the designs considered

### Consequences

    Describe the resulting positive, negative, and neutral consequences on implementing the selected design -
    this could be an summary of all the points like Why, Maintainabilty, Performability etc listed under Design section

### Stake Holders

    Proposer : @abc
    Discussion & Decision members : @cde, @ghf

### Miscellaneous

    Add side notes/followups, if any & rarely

This template is mostly based on the widely used dr-template, and can be tailored for your use case. 
This template is intentionally kept lean, to give the developers and reviewers a consistent thought process/approach. 
Try your best to add all the information required for design discussion in any of the already defined section.
